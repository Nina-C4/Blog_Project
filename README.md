# Blog Project

## Description
Welcome to the **Blog Project**, a fully functional and dynamic blog website built using Flask, Python, Bootstrap, 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite (for development) / PostgreSQL (for production). This project is designed to provide
a seamless blogging experience with user authentication, commenting functionality, contact form for communication,
search functionality, and relational database management.
The site is hosted on **Render**, making it accessible to users worldwide. It's designed to provide a platform for 
sharing articles, engaging with readers through comments, and facilitating communication via a contact form.

## Features
**User Authentication**:
- Signing Up: users can swiftly register and log in. Authenticated users can leave comments on articles, fostering 
        engagement and discussion. Comments are stored in the database and displayed in real-time. 
- Secure Authentication: passwords are securely hashed and salted with werkzeug security, using industry-standard 
        practices to ensure user data safety.

**Dynamic Sections**:
- Several dynamic forms are being used: register, login, create/edit post, delete post. Only admin has create / edit /delete
post rights. Safety measure for deleting posts - a deletion code must be input.

**Search Functionality**:
- Any visitor can search articles and comments to articles by keywords.

**Flask WTForms (forms.py)**:
- Post Form - uses CKEditor 4.14.0 free version (disregard the update warning) for text formatting control. 
  Provides the UI for creating new posts and editing already published ones.
- Registration Form - for users registration in the database (users.tbl - see class User). Password encrypted and salted with `werkzeug.security`, `salt length=10`
- Login Form - for users authentication
- Comment Form - logged-in user can submit comments to each post.
- Contact Form using SMTP integration allows visitors to send emails directly to the site administrator (see below about `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var).


**Responsive Design**:
- Implemented with Bootstrap, it ensures a consistent UX/UI across various devices (mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop).
    Custom CSS and JavaScript enhance the user experience and add interactivity.

**Database Management**:
- Development: SQLite is used for local development, providing a lightweight and easy-to-use database solution.
- Production: PostgreSQL is used in production for scalability, reliability, and performance.
    
**Deployment Ready**:
- It is hosted on Render, a modern cloud platform that ensures high availability and fast load times. 
- The deployment process is streamlined, with automatic updates from the linked repository.

## Technologies
- Backend: Flask Python
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, JavaScript
- Databases: SQLAlchemy (ORM), SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- Hosting: Render
- Email Service: SMTP
- Version Control: GitHub


## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13
- Pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- DB Browser for SQLite (recommended) - for interacting with the local database https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
- PostgreSQL (for production)
- pgAdmin4 - recommended for direct interaction with PostgreSQL database https://www.pgadmin.org/download/

### Steps to Run Locally
1. Clone the Repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nina-C4/Blog_Project.git
    cd blog-project
    ```
   
2. Create a Virtual Environment in your favourite IDE (e.g. PyCharm, VS Code):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
 
3. Activate the Virtual Environment:
    * Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    * macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install Dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Set Up Environment Variables:  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You will need to set the following variables:  
   *Flask framework and databases:*  
   - `SECRET_KEY`: set a Flask app key used for CSRF (a long alphanumeric password) 
   - `DB_URI`: sqlite:///your_path_to_project/instance/blog_posts.db (for development)
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Render Dashboard > Your PostgreSQL DB > scroll down to Connections > Copy `Internal Database URL`

   *Database choice:*  
   - `LOCAL`: `True` to run the app in your browser, using SQLite database  
   ! Note: when configuring PostgreSQL on Render, this env var must be set to `False`

   *Email functionality to send notifications (e.g. new subscriber alerts):* 
   - `APP_EMAIL`: The email address that the application will use to send emails. This is typically your application's "from" address.
   - `PASS`: The password for the email address specified in `APP_EMAIL`. 
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL`: The email address that will receive notifications from the blog. This is typically your admin/personal email address.

   *Delete records in databases* - admin privilege
   - `DELETION_CODE`: blog posts can be deleted only by the admin; as an error-proof and security measure, after pressing the `âœ˜` sign, they will be required to enter this code before confirming post deletion.  
   
   Example code for `.env`:
   ```plaintext
    SECRET_KEY=Fj8Rbyl1knfzWl3SihBof9Cgq
    DB_URI=sqlite:///C:/Users/username/PycharmProjects/Blog_Project/instance/blog_posts.db
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/dbname
    APP_EMAIL=your_coding_email@gmail.com
    PASS=mtdfgvtnjrvjp    # generated in the G_account of APP_EMAIL
    ADMIN_EMAIL=your_personal_email@gmail.com
    DELETION_CODE=a1D6m1i8N0
    LOCAL=True
   ```

6. Initialize the Database:  
   The SQLite local database and tables will be created at the first application run of `main.py`

7. Run the Application in browser:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   Go to `http://localhost:5000/` in your preferred browser to view the blog.

8. Create the first `User`
   Go to `http://localhost:5000/register` and fill in the *RegistrationForm* to create the first user.
   User with id=1 is set as site admin, with full rights to create/edit/delete posts from database.
   
9. Create your first `BlogPost`
   Logged in as admin, after registration, go to http://localhost:5000/ and `Create New Post`.

### Deployment to Render

1. **Create Procfile**:
   Create new file in project root directory named Procfile and add reference to gunicorn.
   ```plaintext
     web: gunicorn main:app
     ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   Ensure your project is pushed to a GitHub repository.

3. **Create a Render Postgre Database and Web Service**:
   - Log in to Render and create a new **Web Service**.
   - Connect your GitHub repository.
   - Set the following environment variables in the Render dashboard:
     ```plaintext
     SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_internal_url
     APP_EMAIL=your_coding_email@gmail.com
     PASS=your_APP_EMAIL_password
     ADMIN_EMAIL=your_personal_email@gmail.com
     DELETION_CODE=your_deletion_code
     LOCAL=False
     ```

4. **Render Deployment (Production)**:
   Render will automatically install dependencies and run migrations based on the `requirements.txt` and specified commands. 
   Once deployed, your blog will be live at the provided Render URL.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
